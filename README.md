Open `index.html` in your web browser.  You may see a prompt that local pages cannot load external resources; if so, serve the folder with a simple HTTP server (e.g. `python -m http.server`) and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. 2. Begin entering your orders, expenses and shifts.  The data will persist in your browser’s local storage. 3. To enable the map and routing functionality, obtain a free Mapbox access token:    - Create an account at <https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/>.    - Copy your **access token** from the dashboard.    - In the **Settings** section of the app, paste your token into the *Mapbox Access Token* field and click **Save Settings**. 4. (Optional) Set your preferred dollars‑per‑mile alertthreshold in **Settings**.  Orders meeting or exceeding this threshold will be highlighted.  ### Deploying on GitHub Pages  You can host the application for free using GitHub Pages:  1. Fork or push this repository to your own GitHub account. 2. Navigate to the repository’s **Settings** → **Pages** (or **Pages** under “Code and automation” depending on the UI). 3. Under **Source**, select the branch (usually `main`) and the root folder (`/`), then click **Save**. 4. GitHub will publish your site at `https://<your‑username>.github.io/<repository‑name>/` within a few minutes. 5. Anyone can then access your Gig Driver tool via that URL, including on mobile devices.  ### File Structure  - `index.html` – Main HTML file that lays out the user interface. - `style.css` – Custom styles thatcomplement the minimal CSS framework. - `script.js` – Contains all of the application’s client‑side logic: data management, charts, routing and event handlers. - `README.md` – This document.  ## Maintenance & Updates  Because the application is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and runs entirely in the browser, updating it is straightforward:  1. Make changes to any of the files (e.g. add new features in `script.js`). 2. Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository. 3. GitHub Pages will automatically update your live site.  If you would like to clear your saved data (orders, expenses, shifts), simply clear your browser’s local storage for the site in your browser settings.  ## Disclaimer  This tool is provided as a convenience for independent gig workers.  It does notconnect to gig platforms directly; instead, you manually enter order data.  The earnings calculations and routing suggestions are estimates intended for informational purposes only.  Always follow the terms of service of your gig platforms and exercise your own judgment when accepting orders.  ---  *Built in July 2025 with ❤️ for gig drivers.*
